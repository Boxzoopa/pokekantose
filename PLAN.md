# POKEMON: KANTO STORY EXPANSION
# **Overview**

**Pokémon Kanto: Story Expansion** is a story-enhanced ROM hack of _Red & Blue_, with loose inspiration from **Pedro Araujo’s Pokémon Red animation series**, which canonizes key implied events like Blue’s Raticate’s death + My own interpreation of events. The game blends adds narrative depth

---

# **Project Goals**
- Tell the _“true” canon story_ of Red based on fan interpretations.
- Include **Plotlines**: Red, Leaf, and Blue, each with unique routes.
- Add **replayability** via unlockables, challenge modes, and canon team mechanics.
- Stay faithful to Kanto’s tone but deepen the characters and consequences.
- Incorporate Gen 1 and 2 pokemon into the game

---

# **Major Features**

## 1. **Expanded Story & Canonization**
- Blue’s Raticate dies on the S.S. Anne → fallout at Lavender Town
- Red is silent but expressive (event-based reactions)
- Leaf is an actual Character
- Blue and Leaf get real character arcs
- Canon team path: reward for following Red's “true” team


## 2. **Canon Teams**
- Red’s Canon Team: Venusaur, Pikachu, Nidoking, Dodrio, Lapras, Snorlax
- Blue's Canon Team: Charizard, Pidgeot, Rhydon, Executor, Gyrados, Alakasm
- Leaf's Canon Team Blastoise, Clefable, Snorlax, Vileplume, Nidoqueen, Fearow

## 3. **Postgame Enhancements**
- Memory Link: Re-battle characters
- Title Defense, Fight in a extra hard gauntlet of trainers
- Hidden storylines unlocked via canon flags
- New island or map area to explore, i.e. The Tohjo Isle

---

# Main Game
## Pallet Town
- You have running shoes from the get go and can run indoors
- Daisy will Give you a Town map when you leave the Lab, so it's Forced
## Viridian Forest
- There's a Simple optional Pikachu side quest, which will give you a buffed up pikachu(Partner Pikachu from Lets Go) and it won't evolve
## Pewter City/ Route 3
- After defeating Brock he'll give an older amber
- The Man selling Magikarp is replaced with a girl(Leaf), she still scams you and is more of a cutscene
## Mt. Moon
- Will incorporate Petrel and Proton into the story(You fight Pretel, SN fights Proton), w/ the Super Nerd Helping out, you still divide the fossils
## Cerulean City/ Nugget Bridge
- Bill will give you a moon stone
- Optional trade w/ Misty, Clefairy for a Staryu or Shellder
- When leaving cerulean, after fighting the grunt, he'll talk about a strange pokemon that attacked him(mew)
- This will now create a new optional event allowing the player to catch mew when entering nugget bridge next time you enter it
- The man who steals dig in the original will admit that he picked it up after he saw a girl(Leaf) drop it, and that she stole it
## Vermillion City/ SS Anne
- Ok, this is a big one, after you fight blue, whose final pokemon is Raticate, If your team contains a Nidoking, A Short cutscene will play where Raticate is knocked off the boat or it's implied and Blue and red cry or something, Blue leaves
- The captain will give you Cut and you're recommended(by LT Surge after fighting him) to go back to Pallet town to apologize to blue, before you progress onwards
- Daisy will give you HM Flash if you do this sidequest
- There's a misty encounter afterwards where she gets you a bike so you don't have to go right back to cerulean
## Lavender Town, first visit
- Lavender Tower is completely locked, you won't be able to access it until you get the silph scope, well you can, but you'll be stopped before you can fight blue
## Celadon City
- You can't go to the rocket hideout when you first enter, Daisy will find you and ask for help as a girl has stolen the last starter, if you go to the edge of Celadon, near the fly area, you'll find a girl(Same one from earlier in game) running away, she's stolen the remaining starter and a pokedex, it's weak and you easily defeat her, the girl, Leaf is introduced to the story and her backstory and such and after thinking about it, daisy decides to to let her keep the starter and dex, essentially welcoming her ot the squad
- Daisy then passes on a message from Oak. He has tasked you(and now leaf) to investigate team rocket in celadon, she mentions telling blue to go to lavender town, You get teleported back to Celadon
- Note: Leaf can be integrated as an NPC who helps Red during key moments
- Leaf and the player Infiltrate the hideout
- scientists in the Rocket Hideout talk about “Project M” or “the final weapon.” or "the Master ball"
- leaf is busy fighting off grunts and you fight Proton, then giovanni
- After the battle with Giovanni, Leaf could have a scene where she **expresses doubt** about her ability to keep up with the team, maybe even suggesting she should leave, she goes on a training journey after you beat Erika
## Lavender Town, second Visit
- You cannot fight blue on first entry, since you have to same task to investigate team rocket, you both battle throughout the tower
- Blue character development during Marowak scene
- When you get to the top, there's an Ariana battle, where blue regains his confidence
- After you help mr Fuji, Blue will fight you
## Fuchsia City
- No changes besides, one of the gym trainers is called Janine
- safari zone fully free roam, no step limit
## Saffron City
- There's a new leaf fight(Fight 2) if you try to enter SIlph co.
- There's no rival fight before giovanni, instead, you walk in on blue fighting giovanni, you fight Archer
- the 2 of you argue and lose in a cutscene after, giovanni wins and obtains the master ball
- you and blue wake up in a healing chamber and your filled in on how team rocket has taken over silph co. and causing chaos in Kanto
- Blue will rush off to rechallenge Giovanni, you follow
- when you arrive you find Giovanni has acquired mewtwo and he defeat both you and blue(cutscene)
- then mewtwo take control of blue and this starts the Silph co. rival battle. Giovanni says he's won
- -- Cutscene(This is more like a long object event instead of a cutscene to clarify) --
- then all the gym leaders, bill, daisy and Leaf arrive to fight giovanni and team rocket(excluding blaine)
- all out war(cutscenes/animted sprites/objects Magma and Aqua Style, though minimized for the Gamboy)
- then you get the master ball back and mewtwo breaks free from control
- leaving silph co. and blows it up partially
- -- Cutscene over --
- all pokemon are knocked out, and giovanni fight with a weaker team of his(this is just the regular silph co. Battle)
- after this player is brought home and you get context of what happened from leaf and paparazzi are in front of your house
- this will allow the play to go and catch the legendary bird now as before you weren't able to(there's a full sidequest, not going into depth in this section)
- after fighting Sabrina, she tells you that 3 years from now, a trainer with a heart of gold will come
## Cinnabar & Legendary Birds Quest
- After you beat Sabrina, you'll meet Looker, who'll take you and leaf to a police station with a detained Blaine(team rocket involvement) and you'll have to solve his riddles in the Pokemon mansion(which you'll only get the Key for the bottom floor after this event), you essentially learn about mewtwo's creation, and you also have to go to Mr. Fuji to get more info, When in the pokemon mansion, you'll have to fight Archer(Fight 2)
- eventually Blaine is proved not guilty and is released allowing you to fight him and access the gym
- -- Legendary Birds Side quest --
- So, once this quest is unlocked you'll be able meet misty on sea route 19, who'll tell and take you to her training area in the seafoam Islands, and you'll be able to fight against articuno(it's locked before in a way that misty helps you get through something), You'll have to get past Ariana(Fight 2)
- After this you'll meet LT Surge and Daisy in Cerulean City, who'll tell you about the issue w/ the power plant, which daisy needs for a new project, the magnet train
- so you, Daisy and LT Surge go to the Power plant, which will allow you to battle against a zapdos. You'll have to get past Proton(Fight 2)
- After that you can meet Leaf and Bill on Cinnabar Island, who'll tell you about the concerns w/ the volcano, which may erupt soon
- so you, Leaf and Bill go south Cinnabar Volcano, which will allow you to battle against a Moltres. You'll have to get past Petrel(Fight 2)
- Daisy will give you an EXP. Share for thanks

- **Sabrina Defeated**

- Giovanni: "You... you really exist. They laughed at me. Said I was chasing ghosts."
- Mew floats near him and nuzzles his hand. A silent moment.
- Giovanni: "I built an empire trying to recreate you... and you were out there, all along."
- Oak steps forward: "Giovanni... We were wrong to isolate you. But you let your anger define you."
- Giovanni: "I never wanted power. I wanted proof. But somewhere, I lost the way..."
- {Music swells. Giovanni stands and walks into the mist. A single Rocket grunt throws down his R-logo badge.}
## Route 23
